# InputfieldTinyMCE

### Rich text editor for ProcessWire 3.0.200+

This is an Inputfield for ProcessWire 3.0.200+ that uses TinyMCE 6.2.0. 
Note this is a development version and will eventually be added to the ProcessWire 
core as an alternative or replacement for the existing CKEditor 4.x Inputfield.

 * - `Config::debugDev` (or string `dev`) for core development debug mode, which makes it use

 * - Makes the admin Setup > Templates dropdown show all templates, including system templates.
 * - On the Basics tab, enables you to select a Fieldgroup independent of the Template. 
 * - Enables you to add "Permanent" flagged fields to a template. 
 * - When editing a template, makes it show a "System" tab with ability to assign system flag, 
 *   predefined page class name, cancel of global status, setting to make the "name" field appear 
 *   in the Content tab of the page editor, option to make page deletions bypass the trash, and 
 *   option to disable the Settings tab in the page editor.
 * - Enables you to copy fields from another Fieldgroup maintained by a system template. 
 * - Makes the "Advanced" tab show API examples with the Inputfield notes.
 * 
 * Page Editor:
 *
 * - Enables showing of "Object type" Page class name on Settings tab Info fields.
 * - Enables you to select System or SystemID status for a Page on the Settings tab Status field.
 * - Enables some template changes for superuser that go beyond configured Family settings.
 * 
 * Other:
 *
 * - In Modules, enables disable of autoload state for existing autoload module, for debug purposes.

/**
 * statusFiles: Optional automatic include files when ProcessWire reaches each status/state
 *
 * **Using status/state files:**
 *
 * - These files must be located in your /site/ directory, i.e. /site/ready.php.
 * - If a file does not exist, PW will see that and ignore it.
 * - For any state/status files that you don’t need, it is preferable to make them
 *   blank or remove them, so that PW does not have to check if the file exists.
 * - It is also preferable that included files have the ProcessWire namespace, and it is
 *   required that a `boot` file (if used) have the Processwire namespace.
 * - The `init` and `ready` status files are called *after* autoload modules have had their
 *   corresponding methods (init or ready) called. Use `_init` or `_ready` (with leading
 *   underscore) as the keys to specify files that should instead be called *before* the state.
 * - While php files in /site/ are blocked from direct access by the .htaccess file, it’s 
 *   also a good idea to add `if(!defined("PROCESSWIRE")) die();` at the top of them. 
 * 
 * **Status files and available API variables:**
 *
 * - Included files receive current available ProcessWire API variables, locally scoped.
 * - In the `boot` state, only $wire, $hooks, $config, $classLoader API variables are available.
 * - In the `init` state, all core API variables are available, except for $page.
 * - In the `ready`, `render`, `download` and `finished` states, all API variables are available.
 * - In the `failed` state, an unknown set of API variables is available, so use isset() to check.
 *
 * **Description of statuses/states:**
 *
 * The statuses occur in this order:
 *
 * 1. The `boot` status occurs in the ProcessWire class constructor, after PW has initialized its
 *    class loader, loaded its config files, and initialized its hooks system. One use for this
 *    state is to add static hooks to methods that might be executed between boot and init, which
 *    would be missed by the time the init state is reached.
 *
 * 2. The `init` status occurs after ProcessWire has loaded all of its core API variables, except
 *    that the $page API variable has not yet been determined. At this point, all of the autoload
 *    modules have had their init() methods called as well.
 * 
 *    - If you want to target the state right before modules.init() methods are called, (rather
 *      than after), you can use `initBefore`.
 *
 * 3. The `ready` status is similar to the init status except that the current Page is now known,
 *    and the $page API variable is known and available. The ready file is included after autoload
 *    modules have had their ready() methods called. 
 * 
 *    - If you want to limit your ready file to just be called for front-end (site) requests,
 *      you can use `readySite`.
 * 
 *    - If you want to limit your ready file to just be called for back-end (admin) requests with
 *      a logged-in user, you can use `readyAdmin`.
 * 
 *    - If you want to target the state right before modules.ready() methods are called, (rather 
 *      than after), you can use `readyBefore`. This is the same as the init state, except that
 *      the current $page is available. 
 *
 * 4. The `render` status occurs when a page is about to be rendered and the status is retained
 *    until the page has finished rendering. If using a status file for this, in addition to API
 *    variables, it will also receive a `$contentType` variable that contains the matched content-
 *    type header, or it may be blank for text/html content-type, or if not yet known. If externally
 *    bootstrapped it will contain the value “external”.
 *
 * 5. The `download` status occurs when a file is about to be sent as a download to the user.
 *    It occurs *instead* of a render status (rather than in addition to). If using an include file
 *    for this, in addition to API vars, it will also receive a `$downloadFile` variable containing
 *    the filename requested to be downloaded (string).
 *
 * 6. The `finished` status occurs after the request has been delivered and output sent. ProcessWire
 *    performs various maintenance tasks during this state.
 *
 * 7. The `failed` status occurs when the request has failed due an Exception being thrown.
 *    In addition to available API vars, it also receives these variables:
 *    
 *    - `$exception` (\Exception): The Exception that triggered the failed status, this is most 
 *       commonly going to be a Wire404Exception, WirePermissionException or WireException.
 *    - `$reason` (string): Additional text info about error, beyond $exception->getMessage(). 
 *    - `$failPage` (Page|NullPage): Page where the error occurred
 * 
 * **Defining status files:**
 *
 * You can define all of the status files at once using an array like the one this documentation
 * is for, but chances are you want to set one or two rather than all of them. You can do so like
 * this, after creating /site/boot.php and site/failed.php files (as examples):
 * ~~~~~
 * $config->statusFiles('boot', 'boot.php');
 * $config->statusFiles('failed', 'failed.php');
 * ~~~~~
 *

 * #property string readyBefore File to include right before 'ready'state, before modules.ready().
